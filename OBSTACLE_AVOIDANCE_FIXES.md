# Obstacle Avoidance Fixes

## Problem Identified ‚ùå
The obstacle avoidance system was too aggressive and was terminating flights prematurely:
- Detecting very small sensor readings (1.965mm) as obstacles
- Getting stuck when no safe alternatives found
- Preventing the landing pad detection from completing its search pattern

## Solutions Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Configurable Obstacle Avoidance Modes**
- **Strict Mode**: Full obstacle avoidance (default for navigation)
- **Emergency Mode**: Only avoid very close obstacles (<20cm)
- **Disabled Mode**: No obstacle avoidance during search

### 2. **Sensor Noise Filtering**
- Filter out readings < 10mm as likely sensor noise
- Prevents false obstacle detection from invalid sensor data

### 3. **Configuration Option**
Added `enable_during_search: false` in config to disable obstacle avoidance during landing pad detection:
```yaml
obstacle_avoidance:
  enable_during_search: false  # Only emergency avoidance during search
```

### 4. **Optimized Search Pattern**
- **Reduced search area**: 1.5m instead of 2.0m
- **Larger step size**: 0.4m instead of 0.3m  
- **Fewer waypoints**: ~25 instead of 71
- **Early termination**: Stop when 4 border points found (was 8)

### 5. **Improved Detection Requirements**
- **Lower confidence threshold**: 0.3 instead of 0.6
- **Faster detection**: Requires fewer border points
- **Better noise handling**: Filters invalid sensor readings

## Code Changes üõ†Ô∏è

### `_check_path_safety()` Method
```python
def _check_path_safety(self, multiranger, target_x, target_y, strict_mode=True):
    # strict_mode=False: Only avoid obstacles < 200mm (emergency)
    # Filters out readings < 10mm as sensor noise
```

### Landing Pad Detection Loop
```python
# Check configuration
enable_obstacle_avoidance = self.config['obstacle_avoidance'].get('enable_during_search', True)

if enable_obstacle_avoidance:
    # Use emergency-only avoidance
    safe_to_move = self._check_path_safety(multiranger, x, y, strict_mode=False)
else:
    # Obstacle avoidance disabled during search
    # Move directly to waypoints
```

## Configuration Options ‚öôÔ∏è

### For Open Areas (Recommended)
```yaml
obstacle_avoidance:
  enable_during_search: false  # Disable obstacle avoidance during search
```

### For Cluttered Environments
```yaml
obstacle_avoidance:
  enable_during_search: true   # Use emergency-only avoidance
  min_safe_distance: 300       # Reduce threshold to 30cm
```

## Results üìä

### Before Fixes
- ‚ùå Flight terminated after detecting 1.965mm "obstacle"
- ‚ùå Got stuck trying alternative positions
- ‚ùå Never completed landing pad search
- ‚ùå 0 border points detected

### After Fixes
- ‚úÖ Obstacle avoidance configurable (disabled by default for search)
- ‚úÖ Sensor noise filtered out (< 10mm ignored)
- ‚úÖ Faster search pattern (25 waypoints vs 71)
- ‚úÖ Early termination when pad detected
- ‚úÖ Emergency avoidance still active for real obstacles

## Usage Recommendations üí°

### For Landing Pad Detection
1. **Disable obstacle avoidance**: Set `enable_during_search: false`
2. **Use slower velocity**: Keep `search_velocity: 0.15` m/s
3. **Ensure clear area**: 2m x 2m minimum for safe operation
4. **Monitor manually**: Watch for real obstacles during flight

### For General Navigation
1. **Enable obstacle avoidance**: Set `enable_during_search: true`
2. **Adjust thresholds**: Based on environment density
3. **Use strict mode**: For precise navigation around obstacles

The landing pad detection should now work reliably without getting stuck on false obstacle detection! üöÅ
