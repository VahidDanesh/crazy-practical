# Crazyflie Landing Pad Detection - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Incorrect Commander Usage**
**Problem**: The code was trying to use `MotionCommander.goto()` which doesn't exist.
**Fix**: Replaced `MotionCommander` with `PositionHlCommander` for waypoint navigation since it provides the `go_to()` method needed for precise positioning.

**Changes Made**:
- Lines 520-531: Switched from `MotionCommander` to `PositionHlCommander`
- Lines 568, 576, 617, 625: Changed `mc.goto()` to `pc.go_to()`
- Lines 636, 638: Updated fallback navigation methods

### 2. **Missing Z-Range Sensor Integration**
**Problem**: Landing pad detection relied only on state estimator height, which is less accurate for ground detection.
**Fix**: Added proper z-range sensor logging and processing for accurate height-above-ground measurements.

**Changes Made**:
- Lines 222-226: Added z-range sensor to logging configuration
- Lines 595-601: Enhanced height measurement processing to prefer z-range sensor data
- Automatic fallback to state estimator if z-range unavailable

### 3. **Sensor None Value Handling**
**Problem**: Multiranger sensors return `None` when no obstacle detected (>8m), causing `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'`.
**Fix**: Added proper None value handling in obstacle detection code.

**Changes Made**:
- Lines 132-138: Fixed `_check_path_safety()` to handle None sensor values
- Lines 700-705: Fixed `_find_free_direction()` to properly convert mm to meters and handle None
- Lines 679-684: Fixed sensor status display to handle None values properly

### 4. **Import Issues**
**Problem**: Relative imports causing `ModuleNotFoundError` when running scripts directly.
**Fix**: Added fallback import mechanism to handle both relative and direct imports.

**Changes Made**:
- Lines 34-37: Added try/except import structure for `landing_pad_detector`

## System Improvements ✅

### 1. **Enhanced Waypoint Navigation**
- **Precise positioning** using `PositionHlCommander` with absolute coordinates
- **Obstacle avoidance** integrated with waypoint navigation
- **Safe velocity control** during search operations
- **Alternative position finding** when obstacles detected

### 2. **Robust Landing Pad Detection**
- **Multi-sensor approach**: Z-range sensor + state estimator backup
- **Configurable detection profiles**: Indoor, outdoor, fast-flight options
- **Spatial consistency validation** to reduce false positives
- **Direction-aware border collection** for better center calculation

### 3. **Comprehensive Safety Features**
- **Emergency shutdown** handling with proper cleanup
- **Battery monitoring** with automatic emergency landing
- **Connection loss detection** and recovery
- **Flight time limits** with safety timeouts
- **Obstacle avoidance** with alternative path finding

### 4. **Improved Logging and Debugging**
- **High-frequency logging** (50ms) for landing detection
- **Multi-variable logging**: Position, battery, sensors
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Flight data persistence** with timestamped CSV files
