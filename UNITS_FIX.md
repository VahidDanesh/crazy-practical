# Critical Units Fix - Crazyflie Sensors

## The Critical Error ‚ùå

I made a fundamental mistake with Crazyflie sensor units that was causing the obstacle avoidance to malfunction:

### What I Thought:
- Multiranger sensors return values in **millimeters**
- Need to convert by dividing by 1000

### Reality:
- **Multiranger properties** (`.front`, `.left`, etc.) already return values in **METERS**
- **The conversion is done internally** by the Multiranger class
- **No additional conversion needed**

## The Evidence ‚úÖ

From `/cflib/utils/multiranger.py` lines 65-69:

```python
def _convert_log_to_distance(self, data):
    if data >= 8000:  # Raw data >= 8000mm means > 8m
        return None
    else:
        return data / 1000.0  # Convert mm to meters internally
```

The Multiranger class:
1. Receives raw sensor data in **millimeters**
2. **Converts to meters internally** (√∑ 1000.0)  
3. **Returns meter values** via properties

## What This Means üö®

### The "1.965mm" Error Was Actually:
- **1.965 METERS** = 1965 millimeters 
- **A real obstacle at ~2 meters distance**
- **Correctly detected by the system**

### My Wrong Fix:
- I thought it was sensor noise
- I tried to "fix" units that were already correct
- I disabled obstacle avoidance when it was working properly

## The Correct Units üìè

| Sensor/Estimator | Raw Data | API Returns | Units |
|------------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Multiranger properties** | mm | **METERS** | `.front`, `.back`, etc. |
| **Range log variables** | **MILLIMETERS** | mm | `range.front`, `range.zrange` |
| **State Estimator** | **METERS** | **METERS** | `stateEstimate.x/y/z` |
| **Position Commands** | **METERS** | **METERS** | `go_to(x, y, z)` |

## Fixes Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. **Obstacle Detection Thresholds**
```python
# OLD (wrong):
if distance < MIN_SAFE_DISTANCE:  # Comparing meters to mm config

# NEW (correct):
MIN_SAFE_DISTANCE = config['min_safe_distance'] / 1000.0  # Convert mm config to meters
if distance < MIN_SAFE_DISTANCE:  # Now both in meters
```

### 2. **Sensor Display**
```python
# OLD (wrong double conversion):
front = f"{multiranger.front/1000.0:.2f}"  # Already in meters!

# NEW (correct):
front = f"{multiranger.front:.2f}"  # Direct use, already in meters
```

### 3. **Free Direction Finding**
```python
# OLD (wrong):
distance_m = (v / 1000.0) if v is not None else 8.0

# NEW (correct):  
distance_m = v if v is not None else 8.0  # Already in meters
```

### 4. **Z-Range Sensor** (Still needs conversion)
```python
# Z-range log data IS in mm, needs conversion:
if z_range_mm is not None:
    height = z_range_mm / 1000.0  # Convert mm to meters
```

## Configuration Update üìù

The config thresholds are still in mm for human readability:
```yaml
obstacle_avoidance:
  min_safe_distance: 500      # mm (converted to 0.5m in code)
  ceiling_min_distance: 1500  # mm (converted to 1.5m in code)
```

## Impact üéØ

### Before Fix:
- Obstacle thresholds were 1000x too large
- 500mm config became 0.5mm effective threshold  
- Everything was seen as an obstacle
- System couldn't navigate properly

### After Fix:
- Obstacle thresholds are correct
- 500mm config = 0.5m effective threshold
- Proper obstacle detection
- Navigation works as intended

## Key Lesson üìö

**Always verify sensor units in embedded systems!** 
- Check the API documentation
- Read the source code 
- Test with known distances
- Don't assume units based on variable names

The Multiranger API is well-designed - it handles the unit conversion internally so users work in consistent meters throughout their code. 

This fix resolves the obstacle avoidance issues and ensures the landing pad detection works with proper spatial awareness! üöÅ
